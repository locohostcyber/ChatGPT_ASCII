# ChatGPT_ASCII

Python script created by ChatGPT (GPT-3) to print command line input to ascii art.

You can run this script from the command line, by providing the string you want to print as an argument.
For example, if you have saved the script as ascii_printer.py, you can run it like this:

python ascii_printer.py "Hello World"

You can also specify a font to use by adding the -f or --font option like this:

python ascii_printer.py -f "big" "Hello World"
